# dotfiles
This is a repo to store my dotfiles (eg, .bashrc, .vimrc, .bash_profile) and other such settings files

A lot of this is directly from @noopkat (https://github.com/noopkat/dotfiles).

# Installation
Clone the repo
Run `./setup` to automatically replace your .bashrc and .vimrc files. Be careful, this will replace your existing files!

# TODO
Change the open message to randomly select between a few so that its not always
"Now this is pod racing!".

Others I have in mind are:
- "You are filled with determination"
- "Hello there!"
- "Go cast your fancy magic somewhere else!"
