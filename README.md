# dotfiles
This is a repo to store my dotfiles (eg, .bashrc, .vimrc, .bash_profile) and other such settings files

A lot of this is directly from @noopkat (https://github.com/noopkat/dotfiles).


# Installation
Clone the repo
Run `./setup` to automatically replace your .bashrc and .vimrc files. Be careful!
